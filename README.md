The objective of the game is to get 3 X's or O's, in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Pseudocode:
Round 1: Player 1 and Player 2 type their names in name boxes.
Player 1 places X first. Player 2 places O next.
Since there are not 3 X's or O's in a row, the game has not ended.
Round 2: Player 1 and 2 place their letters.
Again, there are not 3 X's or O's in a row, the game has not ended.
Round 3: Player 1 and 2 place their letters.
Outcome - there may be 3 X's or O's in a row. If this is the case, the game is over and Player 1 or 2 wins. If not, the game continues.
