[PLAYNOW](https://mjherr.github.io/Milestone-1-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game/)

The starting player will always be X.

On a 3x3 grid, each player will take turns selecting the square their shape will fill.

The objective of the game is to get 3 X's or O's, in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The first person to get 3 X's or 3 O's will win.

Pseudocode:
Round 1: Player 1 places X first. Player 2 places O next.
Since there are not 3 X's or O's in a row, the game has not ended.
Round 2: Player 1 and 2 place their letters.
Again, there are not 3 X's or O's in a row, the game has not ended.
Round 3: Player 1 and 2 place their letters.
Outcome - there may be 3 X's or O's in a row. If this is the case, the game is over and Player 1 or 2 wins. If not, the game continues.
Round 4: Player 1 and 2 place their letters.
Outcome - there may be 3 X's or O's in a row. If this is the case, the game is over and Player 1 or 2 wins. If not, the game continues.
Round 5: Only Player 1 will be able to play.
Outcome - Player 1 or Player 2 wins.
Outcome #2 - The game is tied.
